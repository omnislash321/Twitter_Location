Two folders:

"dependencies"
and 
"source code"

First, go inside "dependencies" and take out the file "model.20120919" and copy it inside the "source code" folder.

Then, compile with these commands, assuming you are inside the "source code" folder. ie /desktop/twitter location/source code and the "dependencies" folder is outside.

javac -cp ";../dependencies/*" Coord.java
javac -cp ";../dependencies/*" Cluster.java
javac -cp ";../dependencies/*" TwitObj.java
javac -cp ";../dependencies/*" KCenterClustering.java
javac -cp ";../dependencies/*" swingGui.java
javac -cp ";../dependencies/*" TwitterRest.java

Then, all the files are completed compiling.

Now, run the program with:
java -cp ";../dependencies/*" TwitterRest

When running the project, the gui will show up.
The top will show the Twitter API calls remaining, make sure to stay within the limit before it refreshes.
Enter a twitter username, **Reminder: They must be public so that the program can access the tweets
Click Submit, and the data will load.
Then, click Next, and DBPedia will be queried to get coordinates. This will take a long time. Instead of waiting so long, you can just stop the program.
If you stop the program during DBPedia querying, the file will remain, so now if you click "Next", it will use that file and save time, however it will be incomplete.
