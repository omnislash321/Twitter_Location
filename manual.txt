In The Dependencies folder: All the jars will be needed.
There is a file called 'model.20120919', this is used for ARK-NLP, so it needs to be in the same directory as the project.

Compile all the classes.
The main function is located in "TwitterRest.java", so run that one.

There are extra files that start with "User_", "nlp_", "ngram_", and "dbpedia_". These can be included in the same folder also, to help speed up the DBPedia queries to save time.

When running the project, the gui will show up.
The top will show the Twitter API calls remaining, make sure to stay within the limit before it refreshes.
Enter a twitter username, **Reminder: They must be public so that the program can access the tweets
Click Submit, and the data will load.
Then, click Next, and DBPedia will be queried to get coordinates. This will take a long time. Instead of waiting so long, you can just stop the program.
If you stop the program during DBPedia querying, the file will remain, so now if you click "Next", it will use that file and save time, however it will be incomplete.
